# DawnIslandK
**DawnIslandK** is an Android client for adnmb.com. It is based on MVVM, following structural designs of [todoapp](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples) and [dagger-android](https://github.com/android/architecture-samples/tree/dagger-android) by Google.

This app utilizes many latest Android features, concepts, propositions and guidlines, including but not limited to: Single Activity Application, Scoped Storage & MediaStore, Kotlin Coroutine, Navigations, Lifecycle, LiveData, Room, ActivityResultContracts, ViewPager2 and Material Design.

This app uses Retrofit2(& okhttp) for API calls, Dagger2 for Dependency Injection(required for repository behind MVVM), Moshi(which provides better support than Gson in Kotlin, i.e. data class constructor with default value).
